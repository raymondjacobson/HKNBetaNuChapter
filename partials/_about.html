    <h3>{{page}} Eta Kappa Nu</h3>
    <p>Eta Kappa Nu is the international honor society for electrical engineers. The Beta Nu chapter of Eta Kappa Nu has been established at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, along with 200 other chapters in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Outstanding students in electrical engineering, electric power engineering, or computer and systems engineering are elected to Eta Kappa Nu primarily from the junior and senior classes of accredited undergraduate programs. Graduate students and distinguished professional engineers are also eligible. Eligibility, naturally, must depend on marked ability, as evidence by scholarship, personal character, useful volunteer services, and distinguished accomplishments, all of which indicate that the candidate will be or is a success in his or her profession. For undergraduate students, eligibility must depend largely on the records established during the first two or three years in college. The purpose of Eta Kappa Nu is best summarized in the Preamble to the Eta Kappa Nu Constitution:</p>
    <p>That those in the profession of Electrical Engineering who by their attainments in college or in practice, have manifested a deep interest and marked ability in their chosen life work, may be brought into closer union so as to foster a spirit of liberal culture in the engineering colleges and to mark in an outstanding manner those who, as students in Electrical Engineering, have conferred honor on their Alma Maters by distinguished scholarship, activities, leadership and exemplary character to aid these students to progress through association with alumni who have attained prominence, we do hereby ordain and establish the following Constitution.</p>
